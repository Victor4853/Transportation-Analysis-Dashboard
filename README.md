### ðŸ“Š Overview

This project provides a detailed analysis of bus trip records to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions in urban transportation planning. It leverages Excel's analytical capabilities â€” including Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX, and VBA â€” to create an interactive, dynamic dashboard.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- **Ridership Trends**:  
  - Weekdays show the highest ridership, especially during morning hours.
  - Weekends experience a notable drop in passenger volume.      
   âž¤ Commuting remains the primary reason for bus usage, with an opportunity for promotional campaigns during weekends.

- **Route and Bus Performance**:  
  - Central Line generates the highest revenue, contributing 35% of total earnings.
  - East-West Express, despite high ridership, contributes only 9% of total revenue.
  - Bus 4 is the top-performing vehicle in terms of trips and passenger volume.
  - Bus 26 is the least utilised and underperforming bus.        
  âž¤ There's a revenue-efficiency mismatch â€” high traffic on some routes does not always translate to higher earnings, suggesting a pricing or passenger type imbalance.

- **Bus Utilization Overview**:
  - 49% of buses were well-utilised, operating within optimal capacity and frequency.
  - 25% of buses were under-utilised, indicating possible oversupply or inefficient route assignment.
  - 26% of buses were over-utilised, risking wear and tear or service delays due to overcrowding.          
  âž¤  Bus utilisation is uneven, pointing to opportunities for load balancing, reallocation, or schedule optimisation across the fleet.

- **Rider Demographics**:
  - **Gender**:
    - Male: 74%
    - Female: 15%
    - Others: 11%
  - **Age Group**:
    - Adults (25â€“44): 42%
    - Middle-aged (45â€“64): 36%
    - Youth (15â€“24): 14%
    - Seniors (65+): 8%
  - **Occupation**:
    - Others: 25%
    - Professionals: 24%
    - Self-employed: 20%
    - Unemployed: 15%
    - Retired: 9%
    - Students: 7%    
    âž¤ The majority of riders are working-age males, with adults and professionals making up the largest segments. Female and senior representation is relatively low.
 
### ðŸ“Œ Recommendations 
- **Busy doesnâ€™t always mean profitable.**
  - EastWest Express has high ridership but brings in just 9% of revenue, while CentralLine brings in 35%. That gap tells us itâ€™s time to revisit pricing or route structure for EastWest Express without chasing riders away.

- **Weâ€™re wasting fuel on half-empty buses.**
  - 25% of buses operate at below 50% capacity. Letâ€™s reduce how often these run or assign them to better-performing routes. It's a smarter fleet management that cuts down waste.

- **Where are the women and seniors?**
  - Data shows fewer female and elderly riders, especially at night.
  - The solution: boost safety with lighting and visible staff. If they feel secure, theyâ€™ll ride more, and they often rely most on public transit.

- **Weâ€™re leaving seats empty during off-peak hours.**
  - Evenings and nights show low passenger volume. To fix this, offer discounts or promotions to attract students, remote workers, or off-hour travellers,  helping fill those quiet buses and boost usage.
